                     <p>
                     As a student myself, I know and understand firsthand the endless struggles of trying to find a "perfect" revision timetable to help me revise but I never could. I always thought "What if someone else did it all for me?" So a couple of friends and I made this 'RevisionHub'.<br><br>The perfect app, the perfect companion, <br> to help you... get your st*ff done.
